The true guts of this work and much more is hosted in the tr29124_test repo: https://github.com/emsr/tr29124_test

This project is to repair and enhance the TR1 math special functions,
add new ideas, implement TR2 maths when they come up.

I want to get rid of random numbers of iterations.

I want to supply functions that work on complex arguments when I can.

I want to speed things up if possible.

What happens to numeric_limits<complex>...
I tink the math things need functions..
